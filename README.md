# Research Internship in Stochastics and Statistics, University of Oslo, 2023

## Overview

This repository is contains my work as a research intern at the University of Oslo, in 2023, oriented towards the study of stocastic volatility models via high-frequancy financial data. The objective is to explore the methodologies and implications of each volatility models, for a various range of assets, in order to study the variability of the prices in a relevant way.

## Repository Contents

- `Report.pdf`: A detailed report of my work and findings.
- `init_data.py` : Acquisition of the raw high-frequency financial data (HFFD).
- `clean_data.py` : Pre-process the HFFD.
- `convert.py` : Time conversions to plot the prices.
- `quadratic_vars_estim.py` : First step of the variational analysis of stochastic volatility.
- `quadratic_vars_estim_bis.py` : Second step of the variational analysis of stochastic volatility.
- `plot_prices.py` : Display prices of the assets.
- `markovianity_test.py` : Implementation of the statistical test of local volatility hypothesis.
- `[asset_name]Data.csv` : Pre-processed HFFD.
